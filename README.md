## What is Tower Game?
Tower Game is a silly vanilla JavaScript game intended as a challenge to practice programming skills.
## How to play?
You need to direct your brainless Knight to destroy the towers by placing your two Wizards in the board or moving the Archer with the keyboard (W,A,S,D keys by default) to block the Knight's movement. When the Knight moves to a tile with a Wizard or an Archer he changes his direction. The objetive is to destroy as many towers as possible.
## Can I change it / extend it?
Please, do it!
